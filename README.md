Purpose:
    This service module acts as an abstraction layer between the backend and
    the Generative AI (GPT-4 or Google PaLM) APIs. It is responsible for:
        - Building conversation prompts with context
        - Handling multilingual input (Hindi, Tamil, etc.)
        - Managing retries and fallbacks for API failures
        - Returning structured responses for downstream services
    
Performance:
    - Optimized to respond within 5 seconds for text queries
    - Implements caching for repeated queries
    - Supports async execution for high concurrency

Security:
    - API key securely managed via environment variables
    - Rate-limiting enforced before sending requests
